    desc: 简单SELECT后过滤,效果等同于先过滤再SELECT
    sql: SELECT COL1 FROM t1 having COL1>1;
  - id: 2
    desc: 简单SELECT后过滤, 过滤条件表达式复杂
    sql: SELECT COL1, COL2, COL3 FROM t1 HAVING COL1 > 10 and COL2 = 20 or COL1 =0;
  - id: 3
    desc: 分组聚合后过滤
    sql: SELECT SUM(COL2) as sum_col2 FROM t1 group by col1 having sum_col2 > 0;
  - id: 4
    desc: 先过滤再分组聚合再过滤
    sql: SELECT sum(COL3) as col3sum, * FROM t1 where col2 > 10 group by COL1 having col3sum > 0;
  - id: 5
    desc: 先过滤再按两列分组聚合再过滤
    sql: SELECT sum(COL3) as col3sum, * FROM t1 where col2 > 10 group by COL1, COL2 having col3sum > 0;
  - id: 6
    desc: 先过滤再分组聚合再过滤再排序
