# Contribution Guideline

## Contribution Welcome!

OpenMLDB is a community-driven opensource project. We welcome all kinds of contributions, such as bugfix, new feature development, test cases, documentations and so on. 

## OpenMLDB Contribution Workflow

### Before Opening Your PR

We encourage you to discuss with us first before your coding. Your discussion channel may depend on what you want to contribute:

- If it is a simple bugfix, or an independent function/module that will not affect other modules: You may raise an issue in our [GitHub Issues](https://github.com/4paradigm/OpenMLDB/issues) and describe your solutions. We will provide necessary feedback to you as soon as possible.
- If it is related to many modules, or an architectural change/improvement: Please contact us in the community and let us have more understanding about your ideas. Meanwhile, we also encourage you to write a formal RFC and post it to the [GitHub Discussions](https://github.com/4paradigm/OpenMLDB/discussions/categories/rfcs).
