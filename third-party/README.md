# Cmake module to download, compile and install required dependencies by OpenMLDB

## Usage
Use cmake to create a build directory and it will setup dependencies into build directory. e.g

```bash
cmake -S . -Bbuild
cmake --build build
```

By default, the built directory is
```bash
third-party/
└── build/
    ├── build/
    │   ├── downloads        # dependencies artifacts download directory
    │   ├── src              # dependencies source code (from VCS) download directory
    │   └── tmp
    ├── src/                 # source code install directory
    └── usr/                 # compiled libraries install directory
        ├── bin
        ├── certs
        ├── include
        ├── lib
        ├── misc
        ├── openssl.cnf
        ├── openssl.cnf.dist
        ├── private
        └── share
```
where compiled libraries are installed into `build/usr`, source code installed into `build/src`
