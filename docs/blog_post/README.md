2024/3/8:
The OpenMLDB community has recently released a new open-source feature platform product - [FeatInsight](https://github.com/4paradigm/FeatInsight). FeatInsight is a sophisticated feature store service, leveraging [OpenMLDB](https://github.com/4paradigm/OpenMLDB) for efficient feature computation, management, and orchestration. FeatInsight provides a user-friendly user interface, allowing users to perform the entire process of feature engineering for machine learning, including data import, viewing and update, feature generation, store, and online deployment. Read an introduction [blog](https://openmldb.medium.com/featinsight-leveraging-openmldb-for-highly-efficient-feature-management-and-orchestration-bc01b6f2907d) and the official [documentation](https://openmldb.ai/docs/en/main/app_ecosystem/feat_insight/index.html). 

Furthermore, we have set up a playground platform for interested users to try out the feature platform as well as the basic functionalities of OpenMLDB at http://152.136.144.33/. PM me to get User ID and password for a trial!
