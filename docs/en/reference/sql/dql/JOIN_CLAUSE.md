# JOIN Clause

OpenMLDB currently supports only one **JoinType** of `LAST JOIN`.

LAST JOIN can be seen as a special kind of LEFT JOIN. On the premise that the JOIN condition is met, each row of the left table is spelled with a last row that meets the condition. LAST JOIN is divided into unsorted splicing and sorted splicing.

- Unsorted splicing refers to the direct splicing without sorting the right table.
- Sorting and splicing refers to sorting the right table first, and then splicing.

## Syntax

```
JoinClause
         ::= TableRef JoinType 'JOIN' TableRef [OrderClause] 'ON' Expression 
JoinType ::= 'LAST'       
```

## SQL Statement Template

```sql
SELECT ... FROM table_ref LAST JOIN table_ref;
```

## Boundary Description

| SELECT statement elements | state            | direction                                                         |
| :------------- | --------------- | :----------------------------------------------------------- |
| JOIN Clause    | Only LAST JOIN is supported | Indicates that the data source multiple tables JOIN. OpenMLDB currently only supports LAST JOIN. During Online Serving, you need to follow [The usage specification of LAST JOIN under Online Serving](../deployment_manage/ONLINE_SERVING_REQUIREMENTS.md#online-serving usage specification of last-join) |

### LAST JOIN without ORDER BY

#### Example: **LAST JOIN Unsorted Concatenation**

```sql
-- desc: simple spelling query without ORDER BY

SELECT t1.col1 as t1_col1, t2.col1 as t2_col2 from t1 LAST JOIN t2 ON t1.col1 = t2.col1
```

When `LAST JOIN` is spliced ​​without sorting, the first hit data row is spliced

![Figure 7: last join without order](../dql/images/last_join_without_order.png)


Take the second row of the left table as an example, the right table that meets the conditions is unordered, there are 2 hit conditions, select the last one `5, b, 2020-05-20 10:11:12`

The final result is shown in the figure above.

### LAST JOIN with ORDER BY

#### Example: LAST JOIN Sorting And Splicing

```SQL
-- desc: Simple spelling query with ORDER BY
SELECT t1.col1 as t1_col1, t2.col1 as t2_col2 from t1 LAST JOIN t2 ORDER BY t2.std_ts ON t1.col1 = t2.col1
```

When `LAST JOIN` is configured with `Order By`, the right table is sorted by Order, and the last hit data row is spliced.

![Figure 9: last join with order](../dql/images/last_join_with_order1.png)

Taking the second row of the left table as an example, there are 2 items in the right table that meet the conditions. After sorting by `std_ts`, select the last item `3, b, 2020-05-20 10:11:13`

The final result is shown in the figure above.
