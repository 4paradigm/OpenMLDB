# Python SDK

## Python SDK package installation

Execute the following command to install the Python SDK package:

```bash
pip install openmldb
```

## OpenMLDB DBAPI usage

This section demonstrates the basic use of the OpenMLDB DB API.

### Create connection

Parameter `db_name` name must exist, and the database must be created before the connection is created. To continue, create a connection without a database and then use the database db through the `execute ("USE<db>")` command.

```python
import openmldb.dbapi
db = openmldb.dbapi.connect(zk="$zkcluster", zkPath="$zkpath")
cursor = db.cursor()
```

#### Configuration Details

Zk and zkPath configuration are required.

The Python SDK can be used through OpenMLDB DBAPI/SQLAlchemy. The optional configurations are basically the same as those of the Java client. Please refer to the [Java SDK configuration](https://openmldb.ai/docs/zh/main/quickstart/sdk/java_sdk.html#sdk) for details.

### Create database

Create database `db1`:

```python
cursor.execute("CREATE DATABASE db1")
cursor.execute("USE db1")
```

### Create table

Create table `t1`:

```python
cursor.execute("CREATE TABLE t1 (col1 bigint, col2 date, col3 string, col4 string, col5 int, index(key=col3, ts=col1))")
```

### Insert data into the table

Insert one sentence of data into the table:

```python
cursor.execute("INSERT INTO t1 VALUES(1000, '2020-12-25', 'guangdon', 'shenzhen', 1)")
```

### Execute SQL query

```python
result = cursor.execute("SELECT * FROM t1")
print(result.fetchone())
print(result.fetchmany(10))
print(result.fetchall())
```

### SQL batch request query

```python
#In the Batch Request mode, the input parameters of the interface are“SQL”, “Common_Columns”, “Request_Columns”
result = cursor.batch_row_request("SELECT * FROM t1", ["col1","col2"], ({"col1": 2000, "col2": '2020-12-22', "col3": 'fujian', "col4":'xiamen', "col5": 2}))
print(result.fetchone())
```

### Delete table

Delete table `t1`:

```python
cursor.execute("DROP TABLE t1")
```

### Delete database

Delete database `db1`:

```python
cursor.execute("DROP DATABASE db1")
```

### Close connection

```python
cursor.close()
```

## OpenMLDB SQLAlchemy usage

This section demonstrates using the Python SDK through OpenMLDB SQLAlchemy.

### Create connection

```python
create_engine('openmldb:///db_name?zk=zkcluster&zkPath=zkpath')
```

Parameter `db_name` must exist, and the database must be created before the connection is created. First, create a connection without a database, and then use the database `db` through the `execute ("USE<db>")` command.

```python
import sqlalchemy as db
engine = db.create_engine('openmldb:///?zk=127.0.0.1:2181&zkPath=/openmldb')
connection = engine.connect()
```

### Create database

Use the `connection.execute()` interface to create database `db1`:

```python
try:
    connection.execute("CREATE DATABASE db1")
except Exception as e:
    print(e)

connection.execute("USE db1")
```

### Create table

Use the `connection.execute()` interface to create table `t1`:

```python
try:
    connection.execute("CREATE TABLE t1 ( col1 bigint, col2 date, col3 string, col4 string, col5 int, index(key=col3, ts=col1))")
except Exception as e:
    print(e)
```

### Insert data into the table

Use the `connection.execute (ddl)` interface to execute the SQL insert statement, and you can insert data into the table:

```python
try:
    connection.execute("INSERT INTO t1 VALUES(1000, '2020-12-25', 'guangdon', 'shenzhen', 1);")
except Exception as e:
    print(e)
```

Use the `connection.execute (ddl, data)` interface to execute the insert statement of SQL with placeholder. You can specify the insert data dynamically or insert multiple rows:

```python
try:
    insert = "INSERT INTO t1 VALUES(1002, '2020-12-27', ?, ?, 3);"
    connection.execute(insert, ({"col3":"fujian", "col4":"fuzhou"}))
    connection.execute(insert, [{"col3":"jiangsu", "col4":"nanjing"}, {"col3":"zhejiang", "col4":"hangzhou"}])
except Exception as e:
    print(e)
```

### Execute SQL batch query

Use the `connection.execute (sql)` interface to execute SQL batch query statements:

```python
try:
    rs = connection.execute("SELECT * FROM t1")
    for row in rs:
        print(row)
    rs = connection.execute("SELECT * FROM t1 WHERE col3 = ?;", ('hefei'))
    rs = connection.execute("SELECT * FROM t1 WHERE col3 = ?;",[('hefei'), ('shanghai')])
except Exception as e:
    print(e)
```

### Execute SQL request query

Use the `connection.execute (sql, request)` interface to execute the SQL request query. You can put the input data into the second parameter of the execute function:

```python
try:
    rs = connection.execute("SELECT * FROM t1", ({"col1":9999, "col2":'2020-12-27', "col3":'zhejiang', "col4":'hangzhou', "col5":100}))
except Exception as e:
    print(e)
```

### Delete table

Use the `connection.execute (ddl)` interface to delete table `t1`:

```python
try:
    connection.execute("DROP TABLE t1")
except Exception as e:
    print(e)
```

### Delete database

Use the connection.execute（ddl）interface to delete database `db1`:

```python
try:
    connection.execute("DROP DATABASE db1")
except Exception as e:
    print(e)
```

## Notebook Magic Function usage

The OpenMLDB Python SDK supports the expansion of Notebook magic function. Use the following statement to register the function.

```python
import openmldb
db = openmldb.dbapi.connect(database='demo_db',zk='0.0.0.0:2181',zkPath='/openmldb')
openmldb.sql_magic.register(db)
```

Then you can use line magic function `%sql` and block magic function `%%sql` in Notebook.

## The complete usage example

Refer to the [Python quickstart demo](https://github.com/4paradigm/OpenMLDB/tree/main/demo/python_quickstart/demo.py), including the above DBAPI and SQLAlchemy usage.

## common problem

- **What do I do when error** `ImportError：dlopen (.. _sql_router_sdk. so, 2): initializer function 0xnnnn not in mapped image for` **appears when using SQLAlchemy?**

In addition to import openmldb, you may also import other third-party libraries, which may cause confusion in the loading order. Due to the complexity of the system, you can try to use the virtual env environment (such as conda) to avoid interference. In addition, import openmldb before importing sqlalchemy, and ensure that the two imports are in the first place.

If the error still occur, it is recommended to connect to OpenMLDB by using request http to connect to apiserver.

- **What do I do if Python SDK encountered the following problems?**

```plain
[libprotobuf FATAL /Users/runner/work/crossbow/crossbow/vcpkg/buildtrees/protobuf/src/23fa7edd52-3ba2225d30.clean/src/google/protobuf/stubs/common.cc:87] This program was compiled against version 3.6.1 of the Protocol Buffer runtime library, which is not compatible with the installed version (3.15.8).

This problem may be due to the introduction of other versions of protobuf in other libraries. You can try to use the virtual env environment (such as conda).
