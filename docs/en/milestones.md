# OpenMLDB development history

## 1. From commercial closed source to community open source

OpenMLDB originated as an internal commercial product of [Fourth Paradigm](https://www.4paradigm.com), an industry-leading artificial intelligence platform and service provider. The commercial AI platform provided by 4Paradigm covers the entire process of machine learning end-to-end application development and implementation, including data governance, feature engineering, model training and inference, and model management. Its products have been deployed and applied on a large scale in hundreds of enterprise-level scenarios.

In 2021, the core development team of OpenMLDB will abstract, enhance, and add many community-friendly features to the core modules of data governance and feature engineering in the 4Paradigm internal commercial products. Today's open source project OpenMLDB. OpenMLDB is born out of a commercial product that has been tested for up to five years, and has a lot of experience and unique understanding in this field. Today, OpenMLDB develops based on the open source and open community, and hopes to help more enterprises complete the transformation of artificial intelligence with low cost and high quality.
