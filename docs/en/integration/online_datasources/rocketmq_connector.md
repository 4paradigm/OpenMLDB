### Connector Usage Demonstration

**Process Introduction**

Specifically designed for real-time data stream access in OpenMLDB's online mode, the RocketMQ OpenMLDB Connector follows a straightforward four-step usage process:

- Start OpenMLDB and create a database, such as "rocketmq_test," for testing purposes. The RocketMQ connector automatically handles table creation, eliminating the need for manual intervention.
- Start RocketMQ and create a topic to serve as the communication channel for data transfer.
- Launch the RocketMQ OpenMLDB Connector to establish the connection and enable data streaming between RocketMQ and OpenMLDB.
- Proceed with testing or commence normal use to ensure the smooth and efficient transfer of data.

**The Key Steps**

The key steps for using this connector is stated below:

**Step 1 | Start OpenMLDB**

By adhering to these steps, users can leverage the power of RocketMQ OpenMLDB Connector to facilitate real-time data streaming and integration in their online OpenMLDB environment.

```bash
cd /work
./init.sh
echo "create database rocketmq_test;" | /work/openmldb/bin/openmldb --zk_cluster=127.0.0.1:2181 --zk_root_path=/openmldb --role=sql_client
```

**Step 2 | Start RocketMQ**

```bash
Build RocketMQ and Start RocketMQ
1. Downlaod RocketMQ
$ wget https://dlcdn.apache.org/rocketmq/4.9.3/rocketmq-all-4.9.3-source-release.zip


2. Compile RocketMQ
If it has already been compiled, please directly execute Part 3 to start RocketMQ

$ unzip rocketmq-all-4.9.3-source-release.zip  
$ cd rocketmq-all-4.9.3/  
$ mvn -Prelease-all -DskipTests clean install -U  
$ cd distribution/target/rocketmq-4.9.3/rocketmq-4.9.3


3. Start RocketMQ
Start namesrv
$ nohup sh bin/mqnamesrv &  
Check if namesrv has been successfully started
$ tail -f ~/logs/rocketmqlogs/namesrv.log  
The Name Server boot success...


Start broker
$ nohup sh bin/mqbroker -n localhost:9876 &
Check if broker has been successfully started
$ tail -f ~/logs/rocketmqlogs/broker.log    
The broker[%s, 172.30.30.233:10911] boot success...
```

**Step 3 | Start RocketMQ OpenMLDB Connector**

First, built the RocketMQ connect runtime environment.

Downloading the project

```bash
$ git clone git@github.com:apache/rocketmq-connect.git
```

Build the project

```bash
$ cd rocketmq-connect
$ mvn -Prelease-connect -DskipTests clean install -U
```

Edit the configuration `connect-standalone.conf` , and the key configurations are as follows:

```bash
$ cd distribution/target/rocketmq-connect-0.0.1-SNAPSHOT/rocketmq-connect-0.0.1-SNAPSHOT
$ vim conf/connect-standalone.conf
```

```yaml
# Unique Id of the current node
workerId=DEFAULT_WORKER_1

# The port address of the REST API
httpPort=8081

# Local storage path
storePathRootDir=ï½ž/storeRoot

# Need to modify to the port address of your own Rocketmq NameServer
# Rocketmq namesrvAddr
namesrvAddr=127.0.0.1:9876  

# Need to modify to the location of the connector plugins folder
# Source or sink connector jar file dir
pluginPaths=/usr/local/connector-plugins/
```

We need to put the compiled package of OpenMLDB RocketMQ Connector into this directory. The command is as follows:

```bash
mkdir -p /usr/local/connector-plugins/rocketmq-connect-jdbc
cd ../../../../
cp connectors/rocketmq-connect-jdbc/target/rocketmq-connect-jdbc-0.0.1-SNAPSHOT-jar-with-dependencies.jar /usr/local/connector-plugins/rocketmq-connect-jdbc
```

Use the standalone mode to start the RocketMQ Connect Runtime environment.

```bash
$ cd distribution/target/rocketmq-connect-0.0.1-SNAPSHOT/rocketmq-connect-0.0.1-SNAPSHOT
$ sh bin/connect-standalone.sh -c conf/connect-standalone.conf &
```

The following indicates that RocketMQ connect runtime has run successfully:

**Step 4 | Test**

![img](images/rocketmq_test.png)

- Create a Mysql data table and initialize test data

- Create a mysql source and pull data from the test table

- Create an OpenMLDB sink and write the data pulled from the source to OpenMLDB

Initialize MySQL test data;

```sql
SET NAMES utf8mb4;
SET FOREIGN_KEY_CHECKS = 0;


-- ----------------------------
-- Table structure for employee_test
-- ----------------------------
DROP TABLE IF EXISTS `employee_test`;
CREATE TABLE `employee_test` (
  `id` bigint NOT NULL AUTO_INCREMENT,
  `name` varchar(128) DEFAULT NULL,
  `howold` int DEFAULT NULL,
  `male` int DEFAULT NULL,
  `company` varchar(128) DEFAULT NULL,
  `money` double DEFAULT NULL,
  `begin_time` datetime DEFAULT NULL,
  PRIMARY KEY (`id`)
) ENGINE=InnoDB AUTO_INCREMENT=15 DEFAULT CHARSET=utf8;


-- ----------------------------
-- Records of employee_test
-- ----------------------------
BEGIN;
INSERT INTO `employee_test` VALUES (2, 'name-02', 19, 7, 'company', 32232, '2021-12-29 08:00:00');
INSERT INTO `employee_test` VALUES (4, 'gjk', 25, 8, 'company', 3232, '2021-12-24 20:43:36');
INSERT INTO `employee_test` VALUES (12, 'name-06', 19, 3, NULL, NULL, NULL);
INSERT INTO `employee_test` VALUES (14, 'name-08', 25, 15, 'company', 32255, '2022-02-08 19:06:39');
COMMIT;


SET FOREIGN_KEY_CHECKS = 1;
```

Create and start RocketMQ conect mysql source connector, the examples is as follows:

```bash
curl -X POST -H "Content-Type: application/json" http://127.0.0.1:8082/connectors/jdbc-mysql-source-test
-d  '{
    "connector-class":"org.apache.rocketmq.connect.jdbc.connector.JdbcSourceConnector",
    "max-task":"1",
    "connection.url":"jdbc:mysql://127.0.0.1:3306", 
    "connection.user":"*****",   
    "connection.password":"*****", 
    "table.whitelist":"test_database.employee_test",
    "mode": "incrementing",     // Incremental pull method
    "incrementing.column.name":"id",   // Specify fields for incremental pull
    "source-record-converter":"org.apache.rocketmq.connect.runtime.converter.JsonConverter"
}'st
```

Confirm task initiation and start pulling data:

![img2](https://pic2.zhimg.com/80/v2-2e76f61a818c5bc31cdd18eca2a8b4ed_1440w.webp)

To create an OpenMLDB RocketMQ sink connector for writing data to the OpenMLDB table, please refer to the following information. (Note: The listening topic corresponds to the table name of the source pull table.)

```bash
curl -X POST -H "Content-Type: application/json" http://127.0.0.1:8082/connectors/jdbc-openmldb-sink-test
-d '{
    "connector-class":"org.apache.rocketmq.connect.jdbc.connector.JdbcSinkConnector",
    "max-task":"1",
    "connect-topicname":"employee_test",
    "connection.url":"jdbc:openmldb:///rocketmq_test?zk=127.0.0.1:2181&zkPath=/openmldb_cluster",
    "insert.mode":"INSERT",
    "db.timezone":"UTC",
    "table.types":"TABLE",
    "auto.create":"true",
    "source-record-converter":"org.apache.rocketmq.connect.runtime.converter.JsonConverter"
}'
```

By monitoring the data entry, we can verify the successful insertion into OpenMLDB. The details are as follows:

```sql
set @@execute_mode='online';
use rocketmq_test;
select * from employee_test;
```
