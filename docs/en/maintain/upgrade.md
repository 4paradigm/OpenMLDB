# Version Upgrade

Here is the impact when upgrading OpenMLDB:
* If the table is single-replica, users can choose:
    - add an extra replica before upgrading and delete it afterwards (achieved by `pre-upgrade` and `post-upgrade`). Then it has the same behavior as the multi-replica case
    - if it is acceptable that the table may be unavailable during the upgrade, users can specify `--allow_single_replica` during `pre-upgrade`, which can avoid OOM caused by adding a replica if memory is limited
* If the table is multi-replica, we will migrate the leader partitions in the tablet to be upgraded to other tablets, and migrate back after the upgrade. If there is write traffic during the upgrade, there may be data loss.

```{note}
We'll use the normal mode(background) to start the components. If you want to start them in daemon mode, please use `bash bin/start.sh start <component> mon`. In daemon mode, `bin/<component>.pid` is the mon pidï¼Œ`bin/<component>.pid.child` is the component pid. The mon process is not the system service, if the mon process crashed, the component process becomes the normal background process.
```

## Upgrade Nameserver

* Stop nameserver
    ```bash
    bash bin/start.sh stop nameserver
    ```
* Backup the old `bin` directory
* Replace with the new bin
* Start the new nameserver
    ```bash
    bash bin/start.sh start nameserver
    ```
* Repeat the above steps for the remaining nameservers

## Upgrade Tablets

```{important}
If there are multiple tablets, be sure to perform sequential operations on each tablet. Do not simultaneously update the configuration of multiple tablets. That is, complete the configuration update for one tablet, confirm the result, and then proceed with the next tablet's configuration update. Otherwise, it may lead to abnormal cluster status. If misoperations result in a cluster abnormality, you can try using the [operations tool](openmldb_ops.md) `recoverdata` for recovery.
```

* `pre-upgrade`: to reduce the interruption to the online service before the upgrade (refer to [Operation Tool](./openmldb_ops.md))
    ```bash
    python tools/openmldb_ops.py --openmldb_bin_path=./bin/openmldb --zk_cluster=172.24.4.40:30481 --zk_root_path=/openmldb --cmd=pre-upgrade --endpoints=127.0.0.1:10921
    ```
  If the unavailability of single-replica tables is ok, users can add `--allow_single_replica` to avoid adding a new replica.

* Stop tablet
    ```bash
    bash bin/start.sh stop tablet
    ```
* Backup the old `bin` directory
* Replace with the new bin
* Start tablet
    ```bash
    bash bin/start.sh start tablet
    ```
* If `auto_failover` is off, we have to manually `recoverdata` to restore data.
    ```bash
    python tools/openmldb_ops.py --openmldb_bin_path=./bin/openmldb --zk_cluster=172.24.4.40:30481 --zk_root_path=/openmldb --cmd=recoverdata
    ```
* `post-upgrade`: revert all the actions done in `pre-upgrade`
    ```bash
    python tools/openmldb_ops.py --openmldb_bin_path=./bin/openmldb --zk_cluster=172.24.4.40:30481 --zk_root_path=/openmldb --cmd=post-upgrade --endpoints=127.0.0.1:10921
    ```

### Confirmation of Upgrade Result
* `showopstatus` command checks whether there are operations that are `kFailed`, and check the log to troubleshoot the cause
    ```bash
    python tools/openmldb_ops.py --openmldb_bin_path=./bin/openmldb --zk_cluster=172.24.4.40:30481 --zk_root_path=/openmldb --cmd=showopstatus --filter=kFailed
    ```
* `showtablestatus` to see if the statuses of all tables are ok
    ```bash
    python tools/openmldb_ops.py --openmldb_bin_path=./bin/openmldb --zk_cluster=172.24.4.40:30481 --zk_root_path=/openmldb --cmd=showtablestatus
    ```
    After a tablet node is upgraded, repeat the above steps for other tablets.

After all tablets are upgraded, resume write operations, and run the `showtablestatus` command to check whether the `Rows` number has increased.

## Upgrade APIServer

* Stop apiserver
    ```bash
    bash bin/start.sh stop apiserver
    ```
* Backup the old `bin` directory
* Replace with the new `bin` directory
* Start the new apiserver
    ```bash
    bash bin/start.sh start apiserver
    ```

## Upgrade Taskmanager
* Upgrade OpenMLDB Spark Distribution: download the new version of spark distribution and replace with the old one located in `$SPARK_HOME`
* Stop taskmanager
    ```bash
    bash bin/start.sh stop taskmanager
    ```
* Backup the old `bin` and `taskmanager` directories
* Replace with the new `bin` and `taskmanager` directories
* Start the new taskmanager
    ```bash
    bash bin/start.sh start taskmanager
    ```

### Upgrade in YARN Mode

In YARN mode, when replacing Spark in the first step, pay attention to the configuration of `spark.yarn.jars` and `batchjob.jar.path`. If they point to an HDFS path, the packages on the HDFS path also need to be updated. In this case, updating the local `$SPARK_HOME` directory of TaskManager will not affect Spark in YARN mode.

The remaining steps for upgrading TaskManager are the same as the steps mentioned earlier.

## Upgrade the SDKs

### Upgrade Java SDK
* Update the java sdk version number in the pom file, including `openmldb-jdbc` and `openmldb-native`

### Upgrade Python SDK
* install the new python sdk
  ```bash
  pip install openmldb=={NEW_VERSION}
  ```
