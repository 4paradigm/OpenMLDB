#  OpenMLDB + OneFlow: Prediction of Purchase Intention for High Potential Customers

In this article, we will use [JD Prediction of purchase intention for high potential customers problem](https://jdata.jd.com/html/detail.html?id=1) as a demonstration，to show how we can use [OpenMLDB](https://github.com/4paradigm/OpenMLDB) and [OneFlow](https://github.com/Oneflow-Inc/oneflow) together to build a complete machine learning application. Full dataset [download here](https://openmldb.ai/download/jd-recommendation/JD_data.tgz).


Extracting patterns from historical data to predict the future purchase intentions, to bring together the most suitable products and customers who need them most, is the key issue in the application of big data in precision marketing, and is also the key technology in digitalization for all e-commerce platforms. As the largest self-operated e-commerce company in China, JD.com has accumulated hundreds of millions of loyal customers and massive amounts of real-life data. This demonstration is based on the real-life data, including real customers, product and behavior data (after desensitization) from Jingdong Mall, and utilizes data mining technology and machine learning algorithm to build a prediction model for user purchase intentions, and output matching results between high-potential customers and target products. This aims to provide high-quality target groups for precision marketing, mine the potential meaning behind the data, and provide e-commerce customers with a simpler, faster and more worry-free shopping experience. In this demonstration, OpenMLDB is used for data mining, and the [DeepFM](https://github.com/Oneflow-Inc/models/tree/main/RecommenderSystems/deepfm) model in OneFlow is used for high-performance training and inference to provide accurate product recommendations.

Note that: (1) this case is based on the OpenMLDB cluster version for tutorial demonstration; (2) this document uses the pre-compiled docker image. If you want to test it in the OpenMLDB environment compiled and built by yourself, you need to configure and use our [Spark Distribution for Feature Engineering Optimization](https://github.com/4paradigm/spark). Please refer to relevant documents of [compilation](https://openmldb.ai/docs/en/main/deploy/compile.html) (Refer to Chapter: "Spark Distribution Optimized for OpenMLDB") and the [installation and deployment documents](https://openmldb.ai/docs/en/main/deploy/install_deploy.html) (Refer to the section: [Deploy TaskManager](https://openmldb.ai/docs/en/main/deploy/install_deploy.html#deploy-taskmanager)).

## 1. Preparation and Preliminary Knowledge
### 1.1 OneFlow Installation
OneFlow framework leverage on the great computational power from GPU. Therefore please ensure that the machines for deployment are equipped with NVidia GPUs, and ensure the driver version is >=460.X.X  [driver version support for CUDA 11.0](https://docs.nvidia.com/cuda/cuda-toolkit-release-notes/index.html#cuda-major-component-versions).
Install OneFlow with the following commands：
```bash
conda activate oneflow
python3 -m pip install --pre oneflow -f https://staging.oneflow.info/branch/support_oneembedding_serving/cu102
```
In addition, following Python packages need to be installed:
```bash
pip install psutil petastorm pandas sklearn
```

### 1.2 Pull and Start the OpenMLDB Docker Image
- Note: Please make sure that the Docker Engine version number is > = 18.03
- Pull the OpenMLDB docker image and run the corresponding container
- Download demo files, and map the demo directory to `/root/project`, here we use `demodir=/home/gtest/demo`. The demo files include scripts and sample training data required for this case.
```bash
export demodir=/home/gtest/demo
docker run -dit --name=demo --network=host -v $demodir:/root/project 4pdosc/openmldb:0.5.2 bash
docker exec -it demo bash
```
- The image is preinstalled with OpenMLDB and some third-party libraries and tools, we need to install the dependencies of OneFlow.

Since we embed the data pre-processing and invoking of OneFlow serving in the OpenMLDB docker, following dependencies needs to be installed.
```bash
pip install tritonclient xxhash geventhttpclient
```

```{note}
Note that all the commands for OpenMLDB part below run in the docker container by default. All the commands for OneFlow are to run in the environment as installed in 1.1.
```


### 1.3  Initialize Environment

```bash
./init.sh
```
We provide the init.sh script in the image that helps users to quickly initialize the environment including:
- Configure zookeeper
- Start cluster version OpenMLDB

### 1.4 Start OpenMLDB CLI Client
```bash
/work/openmldb/bin/openmldb --zk_cluster=127.0.0.1:2181 --zk_root_path=/openmldb --role=sql_client
```
```{note}
Note that most of the commands in this tutorial are executed under the OpenMLDB CLI. In order to distinguish from the ordinary shell environment, the commands executed under the OpenMLDB CLI use a special prompt of >.
```

### 1.5 Preliminary Knowledge: Non-Blocking Task of Cluster Version
Some commands in the cluster version are non-blocking tasks, including `LOAD DATA` in online mode and `LOAD DATA`, `SELECT`, `SELECT INTO` commands in the offline mode. After submitting a task, you can use relevant commands such as `SHOW JOBS` and `SHOW JOB` to view the task progress. For details, see the offline task management document.

## 2. Machine Learning Process Based on OpenMLDB and OneFlow

### 2.1 Overview
Machine learning with OpenMLDB and OneFlow can be summarized into a few main steps. We will detail each step in the following sections. 

### 2.2 Offline feature extraction with OpenMLDB
#### 2.2.1 Creating Databases and Data Tables
The following commands are executed in the OpenMLDB CLI environment.
```sql
> CREATE DATABASE JD_db;
> USE JD_db;
> CREATE TABLE action(reqId string, eventTime timestamp, ingestionTime timestamp, actionValue int);
> CREATE TABLE flattenRequest(reqId string, eventTime timestamp, main_id string, pair_id string, user_id string, sku_id string, time bigint, split_id int, time1 string);
> CREATE TABLE bo_user(ingestionTime timestamp, user_id string, age string, sex string, user_lv_cd string, user_reg_tm bigint);
> CREATE TABLE bo_action(ingestionTime timestamp, pair_id string, time bigint, model_id string, type string, cate string, br string);
> CREATE TABLE bo_product(ingestionTime timestamp, sku_id string, a1 string, a2 string, a3 string, cate string, br string);
> CREATE TABLE bo_comment(ingestionTime timestamp, dt bigint, sku_id string, comment_num int, has_bad_comment string, bad_comment_rate float);
```
You can also use sql script to execute (`/root/project/create_tables.sql`) as shown below:

```
/work/openmldb/bin/openmldb --zk_cluster=127.0.0.1:2181 --zk_root_path=/openmldb --role=sql_client < /root/project/create_tables.sql
```

#### 2.2.2 Offline Data Preparation
First, you need to switch to offline execution mode. Next, import the sample data as offline data for offline feature calculation. 

The following commands are executed under the OpenMLDB CLI.

```sql
> USE JD_db;
> SET @@execute_mode='offline';
> LOAD DATA INFILE '/root/project/data/JD_data/action/*.parquet' INTO TABLE action options(format='parquet', header=true, mode='overwrite');
> LOAD DATA INFILE '/root/project/data/JD_data/flattenRequest_clean/*.parquet' INTO TABLE flattenRequest options(format='parquet', header=true, mode='overwrite');
> LOAD DATA INFILE '/root/project/data/JD_data/bo_user/*.parquet' INTO TABLE bo_user options(format='parquet', header=true, mode='overwrite');
> LOAD DATA INFILE '/root/project/data/JD_data/bo_action/*.parquet' INTO TABLE bo_action options(format='parquet', header=true, mode='overwrite');
> LOAD DATA INFILE '/root/project/data/JD_data/bo_product/*.parquet' INTO TABLE bo_product options(format='parquet', header=true, mode='overwrite');
> LOAD DATA INFILE '/root/project/data/JD_data/bo_comment/*.parquet' INTO TABLE bo_comment options(format='parquet', header=true, mode='overwrite');
```
or use script to execute, and check the job status with the following commands:

```
/work/openmldb/bin/openmldb --zk_cluster=127.0.0.1:2181 --zk_root_path=/openmldb --role=sql_client < /root/project/load_data.sql

echo "show jobs;" | /work/openmldb/bin/openmldb --zk_cluster=127.0.0.1:2181 --zk_root_path=/openmldb --role=sql_client
```


```{note}
Note that `LOAD DATA` is a non-blocking task. You can use the command `SHOW JOBS` to view the running status of the task. Please wait for the task to run successfully (`state` to `FINISHED` status) before proceeding to the next step.
```

#### 2.2.3 The Feature Extraction Script
Usually, users need to analyse the data according to the goal of machine learning before designing the features, and then design and investigate the features according to the analysis. Data analysis and feature research of the machine learning are not the scope of this demo, and we will not expand it. We assume that users already have the basic theoretical knowledge of machine learning, the ability to solve machine learning problems, the ability to understand SQL syntax, and the ability to use SQL syntax to construct features. For this case, we have designed several features after the analysis and research.

#### 2.2.4 Offline Feature Extraction
In the offline mode, the user extracts features and outputs the feature results to `'/root/project/out/1`(mapped to`$demodir/out/1`) that is saved in the data directory for subsequent model training. The `SELECT` command corresponds to the SQL feature extraction script generated based on the above table. The following commands are executed under the OpenMLDB CLI.
```sql

> select * from

Since there is only one command, we can directly execute the sql script `sync_select_out.sql`:

```
/work/openmldb/bin/openmldb --zk_cluster=127.0.0.1:2181 --zk_root_path=/openmldb --role=sql_client < /root/project/sync_select_out.sql
```
```{note}
Note that the cluster version `SELECT INTO` is a non-blocking task. You can use the command `SHOW JOBS` to view the running status of the task. Please wait for the task to run successfully (`state` to `FINISHED` status) before proceeding to the next step.
```
### 2.3 Pre-process Dataset to Match DeepFM Model Requirements
```{note}
Note that following commands are executed outside the demo docker. They are executed in the environment as installed in section 1.1.
```
According to [DeepFM paper](https://arxiv.org/abs/1703.04247), we treat both categorical and continuous features as sparse features.

> χ may include categorical fields (e.g., gender, location) and continuous fields (e.g., age). Each categorical field is represented as a vector of one-hot encoding, and each continuous field is represented as the value itself, or a vector of one-hot encoding after discretization.

Change directory to demo directory and execute the following commands to process the data set.
```bash
cd $demodir/openmldb_process/
sh process_JD_out_full.sh $demodir/out/1
```
The generated dataset will be placed at `$demodir/openmldb_process/out`. After generating parquet dataset, dataset information will also be printed. It contains the information about the number of samples and table size array, which is needed when training.
>train samples = 4007924
>val samples = 504398
>test samples = 530059
>table size array:
>11,42,1105,200,11,1295,1,1,5,3,23,23,7,5042381,3127923,5042381,3649642,28350,105180,7,2,5042381,5,4,4,41,2,2,8,3456,4,5,5042381,10,60,5042381,843,17,1276,101,100

### 2.4 Launch OneFlow for Model Training
```{note}
Note that following commands are executed in the environment as installed in section 1.1.
```
#### 2.4.1 Update `train_deepfm.sh` Configuration File

## 3. Model Serving
### 3.1 Overview
Model serving with OpenMLDB+OneFlow can be summarized into a few main steps. We will detail each step in the following sections. 

### 3.2 Configure OpenMLDB for Online Feature Extraction 

#### 3.2.1 Online SQL Deployment
Assuming that the model produced by the features designed in Section 2.2.3 in the previous model training meets the expectation. The next step is to deploy the feature extraction SQL script online to provide real-time feature extraction.

1. Restart OpenMLDB CLI for SQL online deployment.
   ```bash
   docker exec -it demo bash
   /work/openmldb/bin/openmldb --zk_cluster=127.0.0.1:2181 --zk_root_path=/openmldb --role=sql_client
   ```
2. To execute online deployment, the following commands are executed in OpenMLDB CLI. 
```sql
> USE JD_db;
> SET @@execute_mode='online';

/work/openmldb/bin/openmldb --zk_cluster=127.0.0.1:2181 --zk_root_path=/openmldb --role=sql_client < /root/project/deploy.sql
```

Use the following command to check the deployment details:
```sql
show deployment demo;
```
#### 3.2.2 Online Data Import
We need to import the data for real-time feature extraction. First, you need to switch to **online** execution mode. Then, in the online mode, import the sample data as the online data source. The following commands are executed under the OpenMLDB CLI.
```sql
> USE JD_db;
> SET @@execute_mode='online';
> LOAD DATA INFILE '/root/project/data/JD_data/action/*.parquet' INTO TABLE action options(format='parquet', header=true, mode='append');
> LOAD DATA INFILE '/root/project/data/JD_data/flattenRequest_clean/*.parquet' INTO TABLE flattenRequest options(format='parquet', header=true, mode='append');
> LOAD DATA INFILE '/root/project/data/JD_data/bo_user/*.parquet' INTO TABLE bo_user options(format='parquet', header=true, mode='append');
> LOAD DATA INFILE '/root/project/data/JD_data/bo_action/*.parquet' INTO TABLE bo_action options(format='parquet', header=true, mode='append');
> LOAD DATA INFILE '/root/project/data/JD_data/bo_product/*.parquet' INTO TABLE bo_product options(format='parquet', header=true, mode='append');
> LOAD DATA INFILE '/root/project/data/JD_data/bo_comment/*.parquet' INTO TABLE bo_comment options(format='parquet', header=true, mode='append');
```

```
/work/openmldb/bin/openmldb --zk_cluster=127.0.0.1:2181 --zk_root_path=/openmldb --role=sql_client < /root/project/load_online_data.sql
```
```{note}
Note that the cluster version `LOAD  DATA` is a non-blocking task. You can use the command `SHOW JOBS` to view the running status of the task. Please wait for the task to run successfully (`state` to `FINISHED` status) before proceeding to the next step.
```

### 3.3 Configure OneFlow Model Serving
OneFlow model serving requires [OneEmbedding](https://docs.oneflow.org/en/master/cookies/one_embedding.html). The support for OneEmbedding is currently not merged into the main project. If re-compilation is required, you can refer to the guide as specified in Appendix A. The following steps assume that the relevant support is compiled and saved to directory `/home/gtest/work/oneflow_serving/`.

#### 3.3.1 Check Model Path (`$demodir/oneflow_process/model`)
Check if model files are correctly organized and saved as shown below:
```
$ tree  -L 3 model/
model/
└── embedding
    ├── 1
    │   └── model
    └── config.pbtxt
 ```   
#### 3.3.2 Check `config.pbtxt` configurations.
#### 3.3.3 Check persistent (`$demodir/oneflow_process/persistent`) path
 
### 3.4 Start Serving
#### 3.4.1 Start OpenMLDB Serving
```{note}
Note that the following commands are executed in demo docker.
```
1. If you have not exited the OpenMLDB CLI, use the `quit` command to exit the OpenMLDB CLI.
2. Start the prediction service from the command line:
```bash
cd /root/project/serving/openmldb_serving
./start_predict_server.sh 0.0.0.0:9080
```

#### 3.4.2 Start OneFlow Model Serving
```{note}
Note that following commands are executed in the environment as installed in section 1.1.
```
Start OneFlow model serving with the following commands:
```bash
docker run --runtime=nvidia --rm --network=host \
  -v $demodir/oneflow_process/model:/models \
  -v /home/gtest/work/oneflow_serving/serving/build/libtriton_oneflow.so:/backends/oneflow/libtriton_oneflow.so \
  -v /home/gtest/work/oneflow_serving/oneflow/build/liboneflow_cpp/lib/:/mylib \
  -v $demodir/oneflow_process/persistent:/root/demo/persistent \
  registry.cn-beijing.aliyuncs.com/oneflow/triton-devel \
  bash -c 'LD_LIBRARY_PATH=$LD_LIBRARY_PATH:/mylib /opt/tritonserver/bin/tritonserver \
  --model-repository=/models --backend-directory=/backends'
```

### 3.5 Send Real-Time Request
Requests can be executed outside the OpenMLDB docker. The details can be found in [IP Configuration](https://openmldb.ai/docs/en/main/reference/ip_tips.html).

Execute `predict.py` in command window. This script will send a line of request data to the prediction service. Results will be received and printed out.

```bash
python $demodir/serving/predict.py
```
Sample output:
```

## Appendix A -- OneFlow Compilation
In this section, we introduce the steps for compilation in order to support OneEmbedding for model serving. This support will be merged into the main branch soon, after which the following steps can be skipped.


### A.1 Docker image 
The following docker has been pre-installed with all the dependencies required for the compilation.
```
docker pull registry.cn-beijing.aliyuncs.com/oneflow/triton-devel:latest
```
Start the docker container and map the relevant directories (Here we map `/home/work/gtest` to `/root/project`). The following steps are performed within the docker container.


### A.2 OneFlow Compilation
```shell
cd /root/project
mkdir oneflow_serving && cd oneflow_serving
git clone -b support_oneembedding_serving --single-branch https://github.com/Oneflow-Inc/oneflow --depth=1 
cd oneflow
mkdir build && cd build
cmake -C ../cmake/caches/cn/cuda.cmake \
-DBUILD_CPP_API=ON \
-DWITH_MLIR=ON \
-G Ninja \
-DBUILD_SHARED_LIBS=ON \
-DBUILD_HWLOC=OFF \
-DCMAKE_INTERPROCEDURAL_OPTIMIZATION=OFF \
-DCMAKE_EXE_LINKER_FLAGS_INIT="-fuse-ld=lld" \
-DCMAKE_MODULE_LINKER_FLAGS_INIT="-fuse-ld=lld" \
-DCMAKE_SHARED_LINKER_FLAGS_INIT="-fuse-ld=lld" ..
ninja
```

### A.3 Serving Compilation

```shell
git clone -b support_one_embedding --single-branchhttps://github.com/Oneflow-Inc/serving.git
cd serving
mkdir build && cd build
cmake -DCMAKE_PREFIX_PATH=/path/to/liboneflow_cpp/share -DTRITON_RELATED_REPO_TAG=r21.10 \
  -DTRITON_ENABLE_GPU=ON -G Ninja -DTHIRD_PARTY_MIRROR=aliyun ..
ninja
```
`/path/to/liboneflow_cpp/share` needs to be replaced by the oneflow build directory，which is `${oneflow directory}/build/liboneflow_cpp/share`.


### A.4 Test TritonServer
Copy backend library files to the designated directory:
```shell
mkdir /root/project/oneflow_sering/backends && cd /root/project/oneflow_sering/backends
mkdir oneflow
cp /roor/prject/oneflow_serving/serving/build/libtriton_oneflow.so oneflow/.
```

Start TritonServer：
```shell
LD_LIBRARY_PATH=$LD_LIBRARY_PATH:/root/project/oneflow_serving/oneflow/build/liboneflow_cpp/lib \
/opt/tritonserver/bin/tritonserver \
--model-repository=/root/project/oneflow_process/model \
--backend-directory=/root/project/oneflow_serving/backends
```

Execute the following commands in another command window. If sucessful, sample output will look like as follows:
```
python $demodir/serving/client.py 
>>>
0.045439958572387695
(1, 1)
[[b'0.025343:0']]
```
Note：
- If `libunwind.so.8` cannot be found, you need to map the path for `libunwind.so.8` with `-v /lib/x86_64-linux-gnu:/unwind_path`, and then add to `LD_LIBRARY_PATH` by `... bash -c 'LD_LIBRARY_PATH=$LD_LIBRARY_PATH:/mylib:/unwind_path ...`
- If `libcupti.so`cannot be found, you need to map the path for `libcupti.so` with 
`-v /usr/local/cuda-11.7/extras/CUPTI/lib64:/cupti_path`, and then add to `LD_LIBRARY_PATH` by `... bash -c 'LD_LIBRARY_PATH=$LD_LIBRARY_PATH:/mylib:/cupti_path ...`. To find the actual cuda directory, you can use `ldd ${oneflow directory}/build/liboneflow.so | grep cupti`
