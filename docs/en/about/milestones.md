# History

## 1. From Commercial Closed Source To Community Open Source

OpenMLDB originated as an internal commercial product of [4Paradigm](https://www.4paradigm.com), an industry-leading artificial intelligence platform and service provider. The commercial AI platform provided by 4Paradigm covers the entire process of machine learning end-to-end application development and implementation, including data governance, feature engineering, model training and inference, and model management. Its products have been deployed and applied on a large scale in hundreds of enterprise-level scenarios.

In 2021, the development team abstracted, enhanced, and added many community-friendly features to the core modules of data governance and feature engineering in the commercial products, and finally made it publicly available as an opensource project OpenMLDB. Today's open source project OpenMLDB. OpenMLDB is born out of a commercial product that has been tested for up to five years, and has a lot of experience and unique understanding in this field. Today, OpenMLDB develops based on the open source and open community, and hopes to help more enterprises complete the transformation of artificial intelligence with low cost and high quality.

## 3. Roadmap

The future development of OpenMLDB will firmly follow the path of community-based open source and to benefit more enterprises and developers. In the future, in terms of technology, we will pay more attention to technologies that can effectively reduce the threshold and cost of use, such as cloud-native technology; in terms of community building, OpenMLDB will integrate into the open-source ecosystem, and expand cooperation between industry and academia; finally, we hope that more developers and users can participate in our community and jointly promote the rapid growth of the OpenMLDB community.
