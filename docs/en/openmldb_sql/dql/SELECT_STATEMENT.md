# SELECT Overview

## Syntax Notation

- Square brackets `[ ]`: Optional clause.
- Curly braces with vertical bars `{ a | b | c }`: Logical OR. Select one option.
- Ellipsis `...`: Preceding item can repeat.

```{warning}
The `SELECT` running in online mode or the stand-alone version may not obtain complete data.
The largest number of bytes to scan is limited, namely `scan_max_bytes_size`, default value is unlimited. But if you set the value of `scan_max_bytes_size` to a specific value, the `SELECT` statement will only scan the data within the specified size. If the select results are truncated, the message of `reach the max byte ...` will be recorded in the tablet's log, but there will be no error.

Even if the `scan_max_bytes_size` is set to unlimited, the `SELECT` statement may failed, e.g. client errors `body_size=xxx from xx:xxxx is too large`, ` Fail to parse response from xx:xxxx by baidu_std at client-side`. We don't recommend to use `SELECT` in online mode or the stand-alone version. If you want to get the count of the online table, please use `SELECT COUNT(*) FROM table_name;`.
```

## CONFIG clause

`query_statement` is able to take optional CONFIG clause, as `CONFIG ( key_string = value_expr, ...)`, which make extra configuration over current query. Supported keys and values are:

| key_string | value_expr type | Note |
| ---------- | ---------  | ---- |
| execute_mode | string | SQL `execute_mode`, choose one: `online`, `request`, `offline`. default to value of system variable `execute_mode`. You can view it via SQL `show variables` |
| values | Any valid expression | See [SQL request query in RAW SQL](#sql-request-query-in-raw-sql) |

## SQL request query in raw SQL

OpenMLDB >= 0.9.0 make it possible for a query statement to run as request mode without extra request row info passed in , for example from one of the parameter in JAVA SDK. Those request row informations are
instead allowed inside CONFIG clause, as `execute_mode` and `values`. When CONFIG `execute_mode = 'request'`，it firstly parse request row value in CONFIG `values`.
CONFIG `values` supports two formats：
1. Parentheses `()` surrounded expression list, representing single request row. For example `(1, "str", timestamp(1000) )` 
2. Square brackets `[]` surrounded parentheses expression lists, say it is surrounding N parentheses expressions, representing N request rows. For example `[ (1, "str", timestamp(1000)), (2, "foo", timestamp(5000)) ]`

Parentheses `()` expression is the minimal unit to a request row, every expression inside parentheses should match exactly to the data type of request table schema, which current SQL contains.

```sql
-- table t1 of schema ( id int, val string, ts timestamp )

-- executing SQL as request mode, with request row (10, "foo", timestamp(4000))
SELECT id, count (val) over (partition by id order by ts rows between 10 preceding and current row)
FROM t1
CONFIG (execute_mode = 'request', values = (10, "foo", timestamp (4000)))
```
