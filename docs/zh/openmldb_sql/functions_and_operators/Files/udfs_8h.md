Returns value evaluated at the row that is offset rows before the current row within the partition. Offset is evaluated with respect to the current row.

### function regexp_like

```cpp

**Description**:

pattern match same as RLIKE predicate (based on RE2) 

**Parameters**: 

  * **target** string to match
  * **pattern** the regular expression match pattern


**Since**:
0.6.1


Rules:

1. Accept standard POSIX (egrep) syntax regular expressions
    * dot (.) : matches any single-width ASCII character in an expression, with the exception of line break characters.
    * asterisk (*) : matches the preceding token zero or more times.
    * plus sign (+) : matches the preceding token one or more times.
    * question mark (?) : identifies the preceding character as being optional.
    * vertical bar (|) : separates tokens, one of which must be matched, much like a logical OR statement.
    * parenthesis ('(' and ')') : groups multiple tokens together to disambiguate or simplify references to them.
    * open square bracket ([) and close square bracket (]) : enclose specific characters or a range of characters to be matched. The characters enclosed inside square brackets are known as a character class.
    * caret (^) : the caret has two different meanings in a regular expression, depending on where it appears: As the first character in a character class, a caret negates the characters in that character class. As the first character in a regular expression, a caret identifies the beginning of a term. In this context, the caret is often referred to as an anchor character.
    * dollar sign ($) : as the last character in a regular expression, a dollar sign identifies the end of a term. In this context, the dollar sign is often referred to as an anchor character.
    * backslash () : used to invoke the actual character value for a metacharacter in a regular expression.
2. case sensitive
3. backslash: sql string literal use backslash() for escape sequences, write '\' as backslash itself
4. Return NULL if target or pattern is NULL

Example:

```sql

select regexp_like('Mike', 'Mi.k')
-- output: true

select regexp_like('append', 'ap*end')
-- output: true
```
