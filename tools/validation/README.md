The idea of this solution is to run the same query in both online and offline modes in OpenMLDB and compare their results to ensure they produce the same outcome. 

Run the test_consistency.sh script in /tmp/ and ensure that the paths for OPENMLDB_BIN_PATH, zk_cluster, and zk_root_path are set correctly.
